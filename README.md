# Oh, hello

This mini-project is to capture my attempts to learn and use GameMaker Studio 2 surfaces for the purpose of scrolling text.

## Lerp-y scrolling

My hope is to be able to use linear interpolation to move a current scroll position to the target scroll position over time. While moving that scroll position, I should see text moving up/down the screen, based on the direction things are going.
