# To Do
- Figure out if Draw or Draw GUI
  - My intended coordinates are based on the GUI and not on the room coordinates. Will this be a problem in GMS2?
  - Move the camera to bottom right of the room and see if a surface made in Draw GUI still remains anchored to the GUI coordinates...
- Draw a transparent surface area
- Draw text on the surface and ensure that this shows up on the screen
- Draw too many lines of text so that it exceeds the surface height and note what happens
- If text clips off automatically, begin working on a scrolling solution. Otherwise, resume research on how to proceed.
- (Assuming clipping works automatically) Detect when text exceeds the height of the designated surface and establish a current scroll position 
  - ?: Would the scroll position represent the scroll top? Scroll bottom? How do other GUIs / the web do it?
  - I've seen recommendations that scroll position be 0-1, representing top to bottom
- Set up some basic keyboard handling and adjust the scroll position based on keyboard input
- Whatever the current scroll position ensure the appropriate point in the text block is visible in the surface
- Upgrade this so that a target scroll position is set from keyboard input and current scroll position is lerp'd 
- Implement Option 1: Scrollbar
  - Visualize the target scroll position in a scrollbar
    - It should set the target scroll position by a small increment, based on the height of the text
  - Add a scrollbar thumb and make it represent target scroll position
- Implement Option 2: Up/Down indicators
  - Visualize the target scroll position with up/down arrow indicators at the top/bottom right of the scrollable surface area
    - ?: Should these indicators be part of the surface or in the regular application surface?
  - When scrolling is available in a particular direction, have the indicator visualize the direction as enabled (e.g., brighter when enabled, grayed out / transparent when disabled)
- Implement basic dialogue choices in a windowed menu with scrolling
  - Use up/down arrows for this
  - The dialogue choice handler should dictate scroll position
  - The dialogue choice should support loop-back / cycling to the opposite end of the choices
- In the dialogue choices, provide an option to view a codex with some "lore"
  - When showing the codex window, use the scrollbar with thumb option
  - No loop-back; scroll should smoothly increment by line height of the text
  - Ensure holding an arrow key will commence a smooth, fast scroll
  
  # Research
- My intended coordinates are based on the GUI and not on the room coordinates. Will this be a problem in GMS2?
- Would the scroll position represent the scroll top? Scroll bottom? How do other GUIs / the web do it?
- Should these indicators be part of the surface or in the regular application surface?
- When lerping, how do I time-box the lerp so that the divide between current and target scroll position is "no greater than" a certain time while not requiring that smaller scroll distances take the full allowed time?
